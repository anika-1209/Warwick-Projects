Mind of Mine,MiNd Of MiNdd (Intro),"Now that I'm on the edge And I can't find my way It's inside of my mind of mine Open up and see what's inside of my mind Open up and see what's inside of my, my mind"
Mind of Mine,PILLOWTALK,"Climb on board We'll go slow and high tempo Light and dark Hold me hard and mellow I'm seeing the pain, seeing the pleasure 
Nobody but you, 'body but me
'Body but us, bodies together (I)
I love to hold you close tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you
I love to hold  you close tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you  So we'll piss off the neighbours
In the place that feels the tears
The place you lose your fears
Yeah, reckless behaviour
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw
In the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
Fuckin' and fightin' on
It's our paradise and it's our war zone
It's our paradise and it's our war zone Pillow talk
My enemy, my ally
Prisoners
Then we're free, it's a thin line I'm seeing the pain, seeing the pleasure
Nobody but you, 'body but me
'Body but us, bodies together (I)
I love to hold you close, tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you So we'll piss off the neighbours
In the place that feels the tears
The place you lose your fears
Yeah, reckless behaviour
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw
In the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
Fuckin' and fightin' on
It's our paradise and it's our war zone
It's our paradise and it's our war zone Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise
War zone, war zone, war zone, war zone
Paradise, paradise, paradise, paradise
War zone, war zone, war zone, war zone So we'll piss off the neighbours
In the place that feels the tears
The place you lose your fears
Yeah, reckless behaviour
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw (And raw)
In the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day (No)
Fuckin' and fightin' on
It's our paradise (Yeah) and it's our war zone
It's our paradise and it's our war zone"
Mind of Mine,​iT’s YoU,"She got, she got, she got
Her own reasons for talking to me
She don't, she don't, she don't
Give a fuck about what I need And I can't tell you why because my brain can't equate it
Tell me your lies because I just can't face it It's you, it's you, it's you
It's you, it's you, it's you I won't, I won't, I won't
Cover the scars, I'll let 'em bleed
So my silence, so my silence won't
Be mistaken for peace Am I wrong for wantin' us to make it?
Tell me your lies because I just can't face it It's you, it's you, it's you
It's you, it's you, it's you Could it be that it's a lesson that I never had to learn?
I looked at it like a blessing and now it's just a curse
I don't know why, I don't know why It's you, it's you
It's you, it's you, it's you"
Mind of Mine,BeFoUr,"I've done this before
Not like this I don't drink to get drunk
I feel all the right funk
If there's somethin' I want
I'll take all the right wrongs now
I'm gonna stay in my zone
I'm tired of pickin' that bone
And I can't be bothered
To fight it no more, no Numb on a roof, set it on fire
Just to give me proof, I'm livin' on a wire
Numb on a roof, set it on fire
Just to give me proof, I'm livin' on a wire So say what you wanna say, what you wanna
So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say now
So say what you wanna say, what you want
Shame is you won't say that to my face I've done this before
Not like this, not like this Time for me to move up
So many hours have gone
Heart beats the pump of my blood
No strings for you to pull on
You've got your tongue in your cheek
So pardon if I don't speak
Can't tune my chords
Into your song, no Numb on a roof, set it on fire
Just to give me proof, I'm livin' on a wire So say what you wanna say, what you wanna
So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say now (So say what you wanna say)
So say what you wanna say, what you want
Shame is you won't say that to my face I've done this before
Not like this, not like this Flashing lights So say what you wanna say, what you wanna
So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say now
So say what you wanna say, what you want (Yeah)
Shame is you won't say that to my face
So say what you wanna say, what you wanna (So say what you wanna say)
So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say now (Now)
So say what you wanna say, what you want (No, no)
Shame is you won't say that to my face I've done this before (Never done it like this, baby)
Not like this (Not like this), not like this (Not like this, baby)
I've done this before (Never done it like this, baby)
Not like this (Not like this), not like this (Not like this, this, no)"
Mind of Mine,sHe,"She puts her spirit in a nightcap
She always knows where the crowd's at
She puts her mouth 'round the cigarette
I put it out 'cause she likes that
She always dance when it's rainin'
Hey, when's it startin', baby?
She looks at me like she's waitin'
Makin' time go slow when they show her the table Bright lights, but she's fadin'
Feels right, she's crazy
Bright lights, but she's fadin'
Feels right, she's crazy She wants somebody to love, to hold her
She wants somebody to love in the right way
She wants somebody to love, to kiss her
She wants somebody to love in the right way She's cryin' out that she loves me
Holdin' my hands so I won't leave
'Cause baby don't wanna be lonely
She says, ""I just want you to hold me"" Bright lights, but she's fadin'
Feels right, she's crazy
Bright lights, but she's fadin'
Feels right, she's crazy She wants somebody to love, to hold her
She wants somebody to love in the right way
She wants somebody to love, to kiss her
She wants somebody to love in the right way In the right way
In the right way In the right way, in the, in the right way
In the right way, in the right way (Yeah)
In the right way, in the, in the right way
In the right way, in the right way
In the right way, in the, in the right way
In the right way, in the right way (Right way)
In the right way, in the, in the right way
In the right way She wants somebody to love, to hold her
She wants somebody to love in the right way (In the right way)
She wants somebody to love, to hold her
She wants somebody to love in the right way
She wants somebody to love, to kiss her
She wants somebody to love in the right way"
Mind of Mine,​dRuNk,"We're so late nights, red eyes
Amnesia, on ice
Late nights, red eyes
Amnesia, I need ya Right now, I can't see straight
Intoxicated, it's true, when I'm with you
I'm buzzin' and I feel laced
I'm coming from a different phase when I'm with you Another way now, like we're supposed to do (Ooh)
Take you to the back now, I'd take a shot for you (Ooh)
Wasted every night, gone for every song
Faded every night, dancin' all night long Drunk all summer (Yeah, yeah)

We've been drunk all summer (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Drinkin' and flowin' and rollin', we're falling down We're so late nights, red eyes

Mind of Mine,INTERMISSION: fLoWer,"Until the flower of this love has blossomed
This heart won't be at peace
Give me your heart
Give me your heart
Give me your heart"
Mind of Mine,​rEaR vIeW,"Can your heart be mine
In search?
'Cause I have no time
To help you find all the words
Melodies and memories
Stories that sound absurd
I will tell no lies As long as you look
Me in the eyes
I'll go wherever you are
I'll follow behind (Oh) Heard about all the things you've done
And all the wars that you've been in
Heard about all the love you lost
It was over before it began (Oh)
Heard about all the miles you've gone
Just to start again
Heard about all that you've been through
And it sounds like you need a friend, a friend Please don't wait
I'm not coming home tonight
I wanna love you
But I can't (Oh) As long as you look (Ah)
Me in the eyes (Ah)
I'll go wherever you are (Ah)
I'll follow behind (Behind, oh) Heard about all the things you've done
And all the wars that you've been in (Ah)
Heard about all the love you lost
It was over before it began (Oh)
Heard about all the miles you've gone
Just to start again (Ah)
Heard about all that you've been through
And it sounds like you need a friend, a friend I never doubted myself
But I doubted you
I'm tired of looking at myself
In my rear view (Oh) Heard about all the things you've done
And all the wars that you've been in (Ah)
Heard about all the love you lost
It was over before it began (Oh)

Mind of Mine,​wRoNg,"Oh, we're not on the same place
Show me in the same light
Feels right when we take flight
Clothes off 'cause she's so soft
This ain't a fair fight
I wanna shed light on the subject
I'll get her wetter than ever
Four letters are never the question
She likes when I'm messy
And I like when she's undressing You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't think because you're with me, this is real
You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't stop what you're doing 'cause I like how you're doing it Here with you 'cause you got the right vibe
Seems like you probably got a dope mind
But it's gotta be the right time
We're only good for the night time
I see through your demeanor, baby, I'm a pleaser
I go out my way to treat you, but I can't be a teacher
'Cause I'm a problem with problems, I know who I am and I'm not no good
You can have me tonight or never, I thought you understood
Baby, some people are meant to be loved and others just make it
So take what I'm willing to give and love it or hate it, oh You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't think because you're with me, this is real
You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't stop what you're doing 'cause I like how you're doing it, no Don't stop what you're doin', what you're doin'
Don't stop what you're doin', don't stop, uh I don't, I don't really know (What you're doin', uh)
I don't, I don't really care (Don't stop, uh)
Maybe keep it on the low (Don't stop what you're doin', uh)
Stories that I don't wanna share (I don't, uh, don't stop) You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't think because you're with me, this is real
You're looking in the wrong place for my love (My love)
Don't stop what you're doing 'cause I like how you're doing it, no
You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't think because you're with me, this is real
You're looking in the wrong place for my love (For my love)
Don't stop what you're doing 'cause I like how you're doing it"
Mind of Mine,fOoL fOr YoU ,"This love is tainted
I need you and I hate it
You're caught between a dream and a movie scene
In a way, you know what I mean When the dark turns to mist, I just can't resist it 'Cause I'm a fool for you
And the things you do
I'm a fool for you
And the things, the things you do
The things you do
The things you do When you're lookin' like this
I just can't resist it
I know, sometimes, I hide it, but I can't this time
'Cause it's gonna defeat me
But you won't believe me, believe me 'Cause I'm a fool for you
And the things you do
I'm a fool for you
And the things, the things you do I know, I know
Given the chance, I'd do it again, ah
'Cause I can't help myself
'Cause I can't stop myself
I just love bein' a fool for you 'Cause I'm a fool for you
And the things you do
I'm a fool for you
And the things, the things you do This love is tainted"

Don't stick that knife in my body (Border, border, ayy)
It's somethin' she always wanted (Border)
It's for a good cause, you're doin' a good job (Border, border) And we're off where the wind blows
I don't care where we go
Just like the ocean, you change what I see
They don't know what I know
How long I've had to hold
You're like a commotion, all because of me So take it off, let's break down all of our walls

Mind of Mine,​tRuTh,"My luck's on the game, can't find a way through
Don't know how many times I had to say this to you
This ain't my scene, this weren't my dream
It was all yours, of course
I got caught up in this game
And you know I won't say names of who's to blame I won't point any fingers, I won't say it was you
I'll let life take its time and, in time, you'll see the truth
I won't ask any questions, I won't say it was you
I'll let life take its time and, in time, you'll see the truth See the truth, see the truth
See the truth, see the truth
See the truth, see the truth
See the truth, see the truth My own mind was in the way, front seat, new view
Don't know how many times I've had to talk you through
My dreams, new scenes with enemies
I got caught up in this game again I won't point any fingers, I won't say it was you
I'll let life take it's time and, in time, you'll see the truth See the truth, see the truth

Mind of Mine,​lUcOzAdE,"I'm sippin' pink Lucozade
We're blazin' on that new found haze
I'm seeing in the blacks and greys
I'm hoping that the basket sways
Left to right, sit and talk shit all night
Does that make it right for smoke?
Maybe, or am I just seeing shit?
Seeing the pain inside this house of fear You don't even wanna know about the things I hear
Quick fix, headlights shine bright
You're the fuckin' deer
I'm just wishing it's ambition that got you your position
You'll be fishing for far too long
You're the bad guy in this movie and I ain't wrong
I don't breathe the pollution
And the only solution is making shit confusin' Ain't about who's winnin' or losin'
About the path that you're choosin'
Time heals pain and promotes self-soothin'
When the scars are gone, you can't see bruising
Wanna take these watches, chains and gold rings
I'm gettin' caught up in the feelings that they bring
A lack of sanity, losing touch with reality
Smoking too much, it's starting to fog up my clarity
Travelin' in the day, but you're still lookin' far to me Bulls eye, you the dot to me
Emotions splattered, same pattern
Can't even begin to spot 'em
I'm sad about shit that never happened
No lies in my eyes, nothing but truth will leave my mouth
I'm tryna fuckin' scream, but the words won't come out
Ooh, I'm tryna fuckin' scream but the words won't come out She's older, I told her we ain't meant to be
It takes two, not three, but I'm here anyway
I hope he's leaving soon
Started not to see the elephant in this room
Disguised as your perfume, but the smell of it consumes
It takes all my mind
You can search the world, but you will never find
I see everything you've done to me, be there, you run to me
I don't need to pace, I don't need the stamina
If this shit was it, girl, I probably woulda ran from ya
Kept runnin', outwit 'cause you cunnin'
That outfit 'cause you stunnin', begging 'cause I'm losing mage
Got me feeling some type of way I can't explain
The fuck is goin' on? I think I got it wrong
When I told you I was over you, or were you under me?"
Mind of Mine,TiO,"I can taste it on your mouth and I can't leave it
You're a freak like me, can't you see?

Surrounding your colored eyes

Icarus Falls,All That ,"When I woke up this morning
The sun had just dawned in
My bed, or your bed
Was the first or the last time
I don't care, it feels right
I'm not, not stopping all night
Things fall apart and in a part you feel distant
Reactions are instant if emotions are constant
Let's say for instance that you had a conscience
Would you take the time then to weigh out the options All that, all that
You can give me all that
All that, all that
All that, all that
You can give me all that
All that, all that
Stay here in the morning
You can take it all back
All back, all back
Lay here, if you want to
You can give me
All that, all that, all that Never cross my mind
Have I crossed the lines
Or is there more to find, more to find?
I think inside immortalized
Mortalized, more to life
Coming from both sides
An attack of the mind
Like Optimus Prime in his prime
Kick it, don't skip it, to the finish line
This minute's mine All that, all that
You can give me all that
All that, all that
(You can give me all that)
All that, all that
You can give me all that
All that, all that
Stay here in the morning
You can take it all back
All back, all back
Lay here, if you want to

And neither one, one of us wants to say we're sorry I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I close my eyes and see a crowd of a thousand tears
I pray to God I didn't waste all my good years
All my good years

What the hell were we fighting for?
'Cause now the whole damn world will know
That we're too numb and just too dumb to change the story
Neither one, one of us wants to say we're sorry I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I close my eyes and see a crowd of a thousand tears
I pray to God I didn't waste all my good years
All my good years
All my good years Need a chance just to breathe, feel alive
And when the day meets the night, show me the light
Feel the wind and the fire, hold the pain deep inside
It's in my eyes, in my eyes I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I close my eyes and see a crowd of a thousand tears
I pray to God I didn't waste all my good years

Can I resist the dark abyss?

There's no right that I feel of late
There's no light if my view's at stake
And which life should I choose to take?
What's left, is it room or space?
There are rumours we have to face

I mean down the barrel
I hear 'em sing, it's the same carol

They're tryna fix when it's long gone, don't bother
There's no other, the thought shudders through most lovers

Shoot at will
Because she shoots to kill, yeah
And I'm dyin' inside"
Room Under The Stairs,Fuchsia Sea,"I'm tired of the grey
I'm sick of the pain
I'm tired of the pain
I'm sick of the grey I gotta love this feelin'
To keep myself from dreamin' about somethin' else
And you keep me entertained 'cause I saw the flame, and you still walked through it I bet you knew it, that I would do it if I'm given the chance Ferocious devotion
I can't keep it up, I'm fallin' into motion
Ferocious devotion
I can't keep it up, I'm fallin' into motion Just let me fall into motion
How can you break when you're broken to begin with?
I can't see it with you, I can't live with you
Don't you hear me when I'm talkin'? I bet you knew it, that I would do it if I'm given the chance Ferocious devotion
I can't keep it up, I'm fallin' into motion
Ferocious devotion
I can't keep it up, I'm fallin' into motion I'm tired of the grey
I'm sick of the pain
I'm tired of the pain
I'm sick of the grey"
Room Under The Stairs,Ignorance Ain't Bliss,"If they keep me away from you
It'll better be for somethin' new on another day
Livin' like we are affected by the storm that surrounds us
You can take the weight of moving mountains
On your shoulders, or so you told us
We don't wanna be the one that breaks the cycle
That they call it, never bothered
Tell me somethin' else
Tell me somethin' else I don't wanna live
In this ignorance ain't bliss
I don't wanna live In this ignorance ain't bliss Don't wanna waste your time
And you livin' outside my mind
Said I got a selfish side
Livin' on a risky lie
All the little risky fights
Somethin' inside of me
And I blame somethin' inside of me
And I Don't wanna explain myself
'Cause it better be somethin' good
And it's always the same
Pretendin', it's never endin'
As if the truth could never found us
Hopin' Heaven never counts us
Feel the sun on my skin I don't wanna live
In this ignorance ain't bliss
I don't wanna live
In this ignorance ain't bliss Don't wanna waste your time
And you livin' outside my mind
Said I got a selfish side
Livin' on a risky lie
All the little risky fights
Somethin' inside of me
And I blame somethin' inside of me
And I Can I get somebody to survive?
'Cause it feels impossible to see this high
And I need you, and I need you here
And I Don't wanna waste your time
And you livin' outside my mind
Said I got a selfish side
Livin' on a risky lie (I'm livin' on a)
All the little risky fights
Somethin' inside of me (Inside of me, and I)
And I blame, somethin' inside of me
And I"
Room Under The Stairs,Lied To ,"I've been lied to all my life
I've been lied to all my life In these flashing lights, in this flashing life
Am I fallin' through those cracks again?
Feels like I've been lied to all my life
You got me burnin' for your touch
You got me burnin' for your love
I can't live without you, can't breathe without you
No need to doubt yourself
I'm infatuated with the things you do You do me right
You stay by my side
Through thick and thin
This sentiment don't exist without you
You make me feel alive I don't know what's right or wrong
But I feel like I know
I don't know if I can fight it
'Cause I've been lost alone You do me right
You stay by my side
Through thick and thin
This sentiment don't exist without you
You make me feel alive"
Room Under The Stairs,In The Bag,"Gonna play bad
I'm gonna play hard
I can't tell the difference between my sleeve and my heart
Hey, hey, hey I got it in the bag
I can't tell you nothin' different
I got it in the bag
I can't tell you nothin' different
I got it in the bag But I can't tell the difference
Between my sleeve and my heart I seen the way that my glass stays half full
Just live away to the lazy's focus
I ain't concerned with all that hocus pocus
You can save a wand for them and just show them
I say, ""Wingardium,"" that means I'm levitatin'
I'm feelin' things, when this is gone, still lives within my statement
All in the lift, I'm reachin', what will it take you to see me?
Only can tell the difference between my heart and my sleeve I got it in the bag
I can't tell you nothin' different
I got it in the bag
I can't tell you nothin' different
I got it in the bag But I can't tell the difference
Between my sleeve and my heart And even in this place
I'm in my body, what would it take for you to see?
I just stay awake and rise above it
While I float in this fuchsia sea
'Cause I ain't slept for days, my eyes are burnin'
And what would it take for you to see?
I just stay awake, rise above it
In this fuchsia sea I got it in the bag
I can't tell you nothin' different
I got it in the bag
I can't tell you nothin' different
I got it in the bag Ooh
Ooh
In this fuchsia sea"
Room Under The Stairs,Gave,"Don't wanna bore you with the details
Washed ashore from all the weight
Rest assured, the minor features
Teach us all to learn care I ain't livin' like you
And I never liked you
And I never liked me
'Cause I never had you Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh Always the same
Don't think we gain a thing from this
I'm changin' my ways
Won't meet you halfway
It's all just a game, no one is to blame
Fallin' again and ignite all this place
Makin' excuse, get me out of this place
I know the mistakes, I won't make 'em again I ain't livin' like you
And I never liked you
And I never liked me
'Cause I never had you Ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Don't wanna bore you with the details (Ooh)
Don't wanna bore you with the pain
In truth, we both need it
More than what we gave"
